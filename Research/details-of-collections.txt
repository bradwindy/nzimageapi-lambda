"TAPUHI": 300,748
- Status: ✅
- Thumbnail URL: Large
- Implementation: Multi-step process to fetch high-res images:
  1. Extract IE PID from thumbnail URL
  2. Get DVS session from DeliveryManagerServlet
  3. Extract FL PIDs from viewer page
  4. HEAD request each FL PID to find largest file
  5. Return stream URL through weserv.nl proxy (converts JP2 to WebP)
- URL Pattern: https://images.weserv.nl/?url=<encoded-stream-url>&output=webp
- Limitations:
  - Original files are JP2 (JPEG 2000) format, not browser-compatible
  - Some files are very large (10-30+ MB), causing slow weserv.nl processing
  - May timeout during testing but URLs work fine in production
  - First request to weserv.nl for a given image is slow (cache miss); subsequent requests are fast
